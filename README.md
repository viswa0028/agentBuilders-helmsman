HelmsMan bridges the gap between passive dashboard-watching and safe, autonomous infrastructure management. Instead of relying on rigid, reactive CPU-threshold autoscaling, HelmsMan introduces a multi-agent adversarial negotiation loop running on top of the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. 

Two specialized AI agents—a cost-cutting 
**FinOps Agent** and an aggressive 
**Availability Guardian**—negotiate infrastructure changes over a live Kubernetes cluster. Crucially, safety is not handled via soft agent reasoning; the server evaluates `PodDisruptionBudget.status` live in code, acting as an absolute programmatic safety gate.

# 📌 Overview

**HelmsMan** is an **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** that enables autonomous Kubernetes operations through **collaborating AI agents**.

Unlike traditional monitoring dashboards that simply visualize metrics or CPU-based autoscalers that react to thresholds, HelmsMan **reasons over the live cluster state** before taking actions.

Two specialized agents negotiate every infrastructure change:

- 💰 **FinOps Agent** – minimizes infrastructure cost by reducing unnecessary resources.
- 🛡️ **Availability Guardian** – prevents any action that could violate Kubernetes availability policies.

The result is an AI-powered system that **optimizes cloud costs without compromising reliability.**

---

# ❗ Problem Statement

Modern Kubernetes operations are largely reactive.

Operators continuously monitor dashboards and manually decide:

- Which deployment should be scaled?
- Can replicas be safely reduced?
- Will scaling violate PodDisruptionBudgets?
- Is rollback required?
- Should workloads be moved?

Current autoscalers only react to resource utilization (CPU/Memory).

They **do not understand operational safety**.

This leads to:

- Over-provisioned clusters
- Higher cloud costs
- Manual intervention
- Accidental downtime
- Unsafe scaling decisions

---

# 💡 Our Solution

HelmsMan introduces **AI-driven autonomous remediation**.

Instead of relying only on metrics, HelmsMan:

- Reads the **live Kubernetes cluster**
- Understands deployment health
- Reads PodDisruptionBudgets
- Evaluates node status
- Negotiates actions using multiple AI agents
- Enforces safety directly inside the MCP server

The important part:

> **The Availability Guardian is not just another LLM response.**

Every scaling request is validated against the **real Kubernetes API** before execution.

Unsafe operations are rejected in code.

# 🎯 Key Features

## 🤖 Multi-Agent Decision Making

### FinOps Agent

Responsible for:

- Reducing cloud cost
- Detecting over-provisioned deployments
- Scaling idle workloads
- Improving cluster utilization

---

### Availability Guardian

Responsible for:

- Protecting application availability
- Checking PodDisruptionBudgets
- Preventing unsafe replica reductions
- Rejecting risky scaling operations

---

## 🔴 Live Kubernetes Integration

HelmsMan communicates directly with a running Kubernetes cluster.

Supports:

- Deployments
- Pods
- Nodes
- Services
- PodDisruptionBudgets

No simulated data.

Everything comes from the real Kubernetes API.

---

## 🛡️ Server-side Safety Enforcement

Even if an AI agent requests:

```

scale\_deployment(checkout-service, replicas=1)

```

HelmsMan checks:

- Current replicas
- PDB requirements
- Minimum available pods

If availability would be violated:

```

{
"rejected": true,
"reason": "Scaling would violate PodDisruptionBudget"

}

```

The operation never reaches Kubernetes.

---

# 🌍 Live Cluster Data

HelmsMan continuously reasons over:

- Pod health
- Replica counts
- Deployment status
- Node conditions
- PodDisruptionBudgets
- kube-state-metrics

The demo uses a local **kind** Kubernetes cluster.

# 🎬 Demo Flow

### Step 1

Start the local Kubernetes cluster.

---

### Step 2

Deploy an intentionally over-provisioned application.

```
checkout-service

Replicas = 5
```

---

### Step 3

Ask the FinOps Agent to reduce replicas.

```
scale_deployment(
name="checkout-service",
replicas=1
)
```

---

### Step 4

Availability Guardian checks

- PodDisruptionBudget
- Minimum replicas
- Current health

---

### Step 5

Safety engine blocks the operation.

```
Rejected

Reason:
Scaling would violate
PodDisruptionBudget
```

---

### Step 6

Run

```
change_record
```

Blocked action appears in the audit log.

---

### Step 7

Observe

```
kubectl get pods
```

The deployment remains unchanged.

No downtime.

---

# 🧪 Safety Verification
